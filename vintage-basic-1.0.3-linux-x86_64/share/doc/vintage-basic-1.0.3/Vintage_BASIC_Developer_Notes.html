<body><h1>Vintage BASIC Developer Notes 1.0.3</h1><p>© 2009&mdash;2017, <a href="mailto://lyle@vintage-basic.net">Lyle Kopnicky</a></p><p>I began Vintage BASIC as a class project at the <a href="http://www.ogi.edu">Oregon Graduate
Institute</a>. My aim was to demonstrate advanced knowledge of monads in
<a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>.
It occurred to me that BASIC's dynamic control structures would be
interesting to interpret using a custom monad. Soon, using a
continuation-passing style monad as a basic, I was able to construct an
advanced form of exception handler that was ideal for implementing the
BASIC control structures in a new way.</p><p>What follows are notes on a few of the more notable aspects of the design.</p><h2>Durable Traps</h2><p>Most languages, like C,
have lexical control structures. It can be determined statically where
the boundaries of a loop lie. But BASIC's control flow statements are
read and interpreted one by one at runtime. Traditionally, a <code>GOSUB</code> pushes a pointer to the next statement onto the stack, and <code>RETURN</code> pops that pointer off the stack to return to that position. Any <code>RETURN</code> in the program could be associated with any <code>GOSUB</code>, if the right <code>GOTO</code>s are sprinkled about.</p><p>Instead of using the traditional stack-based method of implementing <code>GOSUB-RETURN</code>, I implemented <code>GOSUB</code> as an exception handler, and <code>RETURN</code> raises an exception to be caught by the <code>GOSUB</code>. Similarly, <code>FOR</code> is an exception handler, and <code>NEXT</code> raises a special exception to be caught by the <code>FOR</code>.
This is not too different from the stack-based approach, because a
pointer stack has been replaced by a handler stack. However, the code
is higher-level and more generalizable. It flows well in Haskell's
monadic <code>do</code> notation.</p><p>Simple Java-like exceptions
will not suffice. For one thing, they require a nested block of code
from which exceptions will be caught. But BASIC has no lexical nesting.
In principle, we want to catch exceptions that occur later in
execution. In other words, we want to catch exceptions from the
continuation of the handler. My new exception handlers can be used in
either way: to <span style="font-style: italic;">catch</span> exceptions from within an expression, or to <span style="font-style: italic;">trap</span> exceptions from the handler's continuation. I refer to it as trapping because it works much like a <code>trap</code> statement in Bourne shell.</p><p>There
are three actions an exception handler may take. In case an exception
does not apply to the exception handler, it needs to <span style="font-style: italic;">pass on</span> the exception to the next outer handler. When a <code>NEXT</code> exception occurs, the loop termination condition may or may not be met. If it is not met, control flow will <span style="font-style: italic;">continue</span> following the handler (the interior of the loop). If it is met, control&nbsp;should <span style="font-style: italic;">resume</span> with the statement following the <code>NEXT</code>.</p><p>There is one more behavior of a handler to consider: whether or not it remains in force. When a <code>NEXT</code> leads to another loop iteration, the handler should remain in force. When the <code>FOR</code> loop is complete, the handler should not remain in force. I refer to this feature as <span style="font-style: italic;">durability</span> and say that in the first case, the handler <span style="font-style: italic;">endures</span>, while in the second case it does not endure.</p><p>The exception handlers provided in Control.Monad.CPST.DurableTraps, <code>catchC</code> and <code>trap</code>, are used to catch or trap exceptions, respectively. Each one is passed, along with the exception, three functions called <code>passOn</code>, <code>resume</code>, and <code>continue</code>, corresponding to the three desired courses of action. Each of those functions takes a boolean parameter <code>endure</code>, which can be set to <code>True</code> to keep the handler in force or <code>False</code> to remove it from the handler stack.</p><h2>Parsing</h2><p>Although I originally hand-rolled a parser, I eventually moved to <a href="http://legacy.cs.uu.nl/daan/download/parsec/parsec.html">Parsec</a> for better performance and error handling. I chose to implement the parsing in three layers. The <span style="font-style: italic;">line scanner</span> layer recognizes BASIC line numbers and allows the lines to be sorted by line number without parsing the rest of the line. The <span style="font-style: italic;">tokenizer</span>
locates and tokenizes keywords in each line, without tokenizing
variable names. I did this so that BASIC code could be written without
spaces between the keywords and variables, as the Commodore 64 allowed.
Finally, the <span style="font-style: italic;">parser</span> does the rest of the work, building up statements and expressions.</p><p>I
took care to make the syntax errors look reasonably old-fashioned.
However, they do provide a bit more information than the old BASICs
would have. Because Parsec provides it, they detail the error position
and the found/expected tokens.</p><h2>Unit Testing</h2><p>Vintage
BASIC is extensively covered with unit tests. These tests are written
on top of the HUnit framework. Most of the tests are on parsing code or
the interpreter. The interpreter tests are at more or less integration
tests rather than unit tests. They test the interpretation of the BASIC
language straight from the textual source. However they are still unit
tests in the sense that they are focused on exercising the behavior of
the interpreter proper.</p><p>The tests are arranged in a hierarchical directory structure parallel to the implementation: in the <code>test</code> directory rather than <code>src</code>. They are executed by a harness called <code>run_tests.hs</code> in the root directory. This custom-written script finds all of the modules named ending in <code>_test</code>, and the functions within those modules starting with <code>test_</code>. It builds a driver program that calls all the tests, and executes it.</p><p>The tests can be run by calling <code>cabal test</code>, or if you have <code>stack</code> installed, then via <code>stack test</code>.</p></body></html>
